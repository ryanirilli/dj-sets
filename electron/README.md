# DJ Sets Electron App

An Electron wrapper for the DJ Sets web application with system audio support.

## Development

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
# Navigate to the electron directory
cd electron

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm start
```

## Building

To build the application for distribution:

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run package

# Build for macOS (Universal - Intel and Apple Silicon)
npm run package-mac-universal

# Build for specific platforms
npm run package-mac
npm run package-win
npm run package-linux
```

## System Audio Support

This Electron wrapper enhances the web application by adding system audio access capabilities that aren't available in regular browsers. The app:

1. Auto-approves necessary media permissions
2. Provides a custom protocol handler for system audio
3. Includes a preload script that enhances the web app's ability to access system audio

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter audio-related issues:

1. Check the DevTools console (View â†’ Toggle Developer Tools)
2. Ensure you have granted the app the necessary permissions in your OS settings
3. On macOS, you may need to install [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) or similar audio routing tools
4. On Windows, consider using [Virtual Audio Cable](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/)

## Notes

This Electron app loads the deployed web application from https://dj-sets-gamma.vercel.app/ while providing enhanced system audio capabilities.
